- **Rolling Animations**: Keyframes for rolling number effects
- **Card Float**: 3D floating animations for cards
- **Glow Effects**: Multiple color-coded glow effects (blue, green, purple, pink)
- **Shimmer Effects**: Animated shine overlays
- **Magnetic Hover**: Scale and transform hover effects
- **Tilt Effects**: 3D rotation on hover

## Enhanced Pages & Components

### 1. Hero Section (`src/components/homepage/HeroSection.tsx`)

### 3. CVs Page (`src/pages/CVs.tsx`)
- **3D CV Cards**: Enhanced CV listing with floating card effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Scale animations on buttons and hover effects
- **Rotating Icons**: File icons with 360-degree rotation on hover
- **Staggered Loading**: Sequential appearance of CV cards

### 4. Jobs Page (`src/pages/Jobs.tsx`)
- **3D Job Cards**: Enhanced job listings with card-3d effects
- **Animated Match Scores**: Rolling counters for job match percentages
- **Rotating Star Icons**: Continuously rotating star icons for match scores
- **Interactive Sidebar**: Animated job details with smooth transitions
- **Hover Effects**: Scale and position animations on job information

### 5. Interview Coach (`src/components/interview/InterviewCoach.tsx`)
- Already had Framer Motion animations
- Enhanced with additional 3D effects and improved transitions

## Animation Features

### Visual Effects
1. **3D Transformations**: Cards tilt and rotate based on mouse position
2. **Floating Elements**: Subtle up-down floating animations
3. **Glow Effects**: Color-coded glows that activate on hover
4. **Shimmer Animations**: Light sweep effects across elements
5. **Rolling Numbers**: Smooth counter animations with spring physics

### Interaction Animations
1. **Hover Effects**: Scale, rotate, and glow transformations
2. **Click Effects**: Scale-down animations on button press
3. **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and staggered appearances
4. **Icon Rotations**: 360-degree rotations on hover
5. **Magnetic Effects**: Elements that "attract" the cursor

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Will-change**: CSS properties optimized for animations
2. **Transform3d**: Hardware acceleration for smooth performance
3. **Staggered Loading**: Prevents animation overload
4. **Spring Physics**: Natural, smooth transitions using Framer Motion

## Technology Stack
- **Framer Motion**: Primary animation library for React components
- **CSS3 Transforms**: Hardware-accelerated 3D transformations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes for styling and animations
- **React Hooks**: State management for animation triggers
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe animation components

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS3 transform support
- Hardware acceleration for smooth 60fps animations
- Fallback styles for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive animations

## Usage Examples

### Animated Counter
```tsx
<AnimatedCounter value={98} suffix="%" duration={2} />
```

### 3D Card
```tsx
<Card3D glowColor="rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3)">
  <div>Your content here</div>
</Card3D>
```

### Floating Card
```tsx
<FloatingCard delay={0.2}>
  <Card className="card-3d glow-blue">
    Content with 3D effects
  </Card>
</FloatingCard>
```

## Performance Notes
- All animations use `transform` and `opacity` for optimal performance
- GPU acceleration enabled for 3D transformations
- Animations are throttled and optimized for 60fps
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

## Future Enhancements
1. **Particle Effects**: Background particle animations
2. **Morphing Shapes**: SVG path morphing animations
3. **Scroll Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations
4. **Loading Sequences**: Advanced loading state animations
5. **Gesture Support**: Touch and swipe animations for mobile

The application now features a premium, modern interface with smooth 3D animations that enhance user engagement while maintaining excellent performance across all devices.
