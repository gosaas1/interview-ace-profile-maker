## ðŸš€ **THE HORMOZI SALES SCRIPTS**

### **The Pattern Interrupt Opening:**
```
"Hey [Name], quick question - how much money have you left on the table 
by NOT getting that promotion last year?"

[Wait for response]

"Right. So if I could show you how to 2x your interview success rate 
and land offers 40% faster, and it cost you less than a Netflix 
subscription... would you at least want to see how it works?"
```

### **The Pain Amplification:**
```
"Let me ask you something. How does it FEEL when you send out 50 
applications and hear... nothing? 

When you see people with WORSE qualifications getting the jobs YOU want?

When you're scrolling LinkedIn at 2AM wondering if you'll EVER 
break through?"

[Let them feel it]

"Here's the thing - every day you wait is another day someone LESS 
qualified is getting YOUR dream job. How much is that costing you?"
```

### **The Value Stack Close:**
```
"Alright, here's what you get when you say yes today:

âœ… Our AI analyzes your CV in 30 seconds (normally Â£199)
âœ… Rewrites it for EVERY job you apply to (normally Â£99 each)
âœ… Applies to 100+ jobs with ONE click (normally Â£5 per application)
âœ… Coaches you through interviews with real AI feedback (normally Â£150/session)
âœ… Tracks everything so you KNOW what's working (priceless)

If you bought this separately, you'd pay Â£2,000+ MINIMUM.

Your investment today? Â£14.99/month.

But here's the kicker - I can only offer the early bird pricing to 
the first 1,000 people. After that, it goes to Â£29.99.

The button's right there. What do you want to do?"
```

## ðŸ”¥ **THE OBJECTION ANNIHILATION SYSTEM**

### **"It's too expensive"**
*"Expensive compared to what? Staying unemployed for another 6 months? 
The average salary increase from a job change is Â£8,000. 
If this gets you hired ONE WEEK faster, it paid for itself 500x over. 
You're not buying software, you're buying your FUTURE."*

### **"I need to think about it"**
*"I get it. Here's what I know - people who 'think about it' are still 
thinking about it 6 months later while watching others get promoted. 
The application queue is live. Every hour you wait, 50 more people 
apply to YOUR dream job. What exactly do you need to think about?"*

### **"Does this really work?"**
*"Fair question. 847 people got hired using this system last month. 
Want to see the testimonials? But here's the better question - 
what's your current success rate? If it's not 100%, then literally 
ANYTHING we do will be an improvement."*

### **"I'll do it myself"**
*"Absolutely! You should definitely spend the next 6 months learning 
AI optimization, ATS algorithms, interview psychology, and job market 
analysis instead of just... getting hired. Makes total sense."*

## ðŸ’¡ **THE URGENCY & SCARCITY STACK**

### **Real Scarcity (Not Fake BS):**
1. **"Only 1,000 early bird spots"** (REAL - we track this)
2. **"Prices increase July 1st"** (REAL - we have a calendar)
3. **"Your competition is applying TODAY"** (REAL - job market truth)
4. **"Interview seasons are short"** (REAL - hiring cycles)

### **The FOMO Amplifier:**
*"Listen, while you're 'thinking about it,' someone with your EXACT 
background just applied to YOUR target company using our system. 
They'll get the interview. They'll get coached. They'll get hired.
Will that be you or them?"*
